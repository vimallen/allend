Within the hospitality industry, Andy Thornton was the first company to offer such a vast range of products and services as a one-stop shop. Contract furniture, interior lighting, metal fittings, timber carvings, stained glass, decorative castings, decor and architectural antiques could all be supplied. Until the company sold its project joinery arm in 2012, complete interiors were designed and installed all over the world. All of this had to be contained in a printed document.
