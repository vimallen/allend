In 2013 a friend was kind enough to buy me a course at the [Curry Academy][1]. I highly recommend it if you're anywhere near the splendid garden city of Huddersfield. The particular course I took was Restaurant Style Cooking, the point of which is summarised here:

> Have you ever wondered why curries cooked at home never taste like the ones ordered from a restaurant? This course will de-mystify the cooking techniques used to produce restaurant standard dishes.

What I hadn't appreciated was how much time could be taken out of the process, without losing any of the flavours of a properly home-cooked dish. And how few ingredients are required. Using this recipe I'm now cooking more curries than before and all without having to go through the tedious process of chopping and peeling garlic and ginger. So let's get to it.

#### Ingredients
* Cubes of frozen garlic and ginger
* 2 Medium size onions
* Meat of choice: I usually use chicken but not breast. Thigh fillets seem to absorb the flavours much better. Leaving it on the bone is extra tasty.
* Whole cumin seeds
* Cumin powder
* Turmeric powder
* Chilli powder
* Tandoori masala powder
* Salt
* Vegetable oil
