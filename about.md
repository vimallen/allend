Hello. As you've no doubt established by now, my name is Dave Allen. I'm a graphic designer working at
[andythornton.com](http://andythornton.com/), where I manage and produce their huge product catalogue, in addition to a
range of other print acivity. I'm also responsible for the company's digital content and direction.

Outside of working hours I like to get outdoors as much as possible, usually on a mountain bike ( I was a founding
member of a biking club) and have been biking since 1993&#42;. I have a decent collection of cookery books but don't use them half as much as I say I do. Music has always been important. I spend far too much online, learning new software skills; learning new things never seems like hard work.

&#42; _Disclaimer: there were breaks. With pies. I'm not entering any races._
