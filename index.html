  <p class="intro-home">When I built this site in 2009, I thought it woud be a place where I wrote about design. I didn't.
  Instead I just clipped things into other places, owned by third parties. First Evernote, then Springpad, and then Google
  Keep. I had effectively censored myself. No longer. Anything goes. A particular post might not be useful to anyone else
  in the world, but if you have your own web site then surely that is the best place to keep things.</p>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
