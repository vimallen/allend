  <p class="intro-home">When I built this site in 2009, I thought it woud be a place where I wrote about design. I didn't.
  Instead I just clipped things into other places, owned by third parties. First Evernote, then Springpad, and then Google
  Keep. I had effectively censored myself. No longer. Anything goes. A particular post might not be useful to anyone else
  in the world, but if you have your own web site then surely that is the best place to keep things.</p>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
	  {% unless post.draft %} <!--private posts. Mark posts in front matter as draft: true http://kellysutton.com/2015/02/18/public-drafts-with-jekyll.html-->
